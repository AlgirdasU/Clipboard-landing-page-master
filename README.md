## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

This is the first project in which I used Bootstrap and SCSS. Bootstrap can help write code much faster then using only CSS or SCSS. However, there are some situations where it is better to use SCSS for e.g
when we nead large margins.
